# Interactive Storytelling AI

Welcome to the Interactive Storytelling AI project! This repository contains code for an AI-powered storytelling tool that generates interactive narratives based on user prompts and inputs.

## Overview
Interactive Storytelling AI utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to generate personalized and engaging stories. The project combines the power of Generative Pre-trained Transformers 2 (GPT-2) for text generation and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image generation, creating immersive narratives tailored to user specifications.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Transformers library
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the model used)
- For GAN model:
  - TensorFlow or PyTorch
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the required dependencies: pip install transformers
4. Run the main script: python storytelling_ai.py
5. Follow the prompts to input your story details:
   - Enter the starting prompt for the story
   - Specify the number of characters involved in the story
   - Enter the names of each character involved
   - Provide the desired ending for the story
6. Once all inputs are provided, the program will generate the story and display it along with an accompanying image.
